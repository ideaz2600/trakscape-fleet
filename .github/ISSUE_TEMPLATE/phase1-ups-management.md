## Overview
Implement UPS HAT integration for reliable power management and graceful shutdown.

## Requirements
- [ ] I2C communication with UPS HAT
- [ ] Battery level monitoring
- [ ] Power source detection
- [ ] Graceful shutdown triggers
- [ ] Power event logging
- [ ] Battery health tracking

## Technical Details
- I2C address: 0x36 (typical)
- Communication: SMBus
- Voltage range: 3.0V - 4.2V
- Capacity: 2x 18650 batteries
- Output: 5V up to 5A

## Implementation Tasks
1. **I2C Setup**
   - Enable I2C in raspi-config
   - Install i2c-tools
   - Detect UPS at address
   - Initialize communication

2. **Monitoring Functions**
   - Battery voltage reading
   - Current draw measurement
   - Charging status
   - Temperature monitoring
   - Remaining capacity

3. **Power Management**
   - AC power loss detection
   - Low battery threshold (20%)
   - Critical battery (5%)
   - Shutdown sequence
   - Data flush before shutdown

4. **Event Handling**
   ```python
   Events:
   - POWER_LOST
   - POWER_RESTORED  
   - BATTERY_LOW
   - BATTERY_CRITICAL
   - SHUTDOWN_INITIATED
   ```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] UPS communication established
- [ ] Battery level accurate within 5%
- [ ] Power loss detected within 1 second
- [ ] Graceful shutdown works reliably
- [ ] All data saved before shutdown

## Testing
- Power disconnection test
- Battery drain test
- Shutdown sequence validation
- Recovery after power restore
- Long-term battery monitoring

## Dependencies
- smbus2 library
- RPi.GPIO library
- I2C enabled on Pi
